                <p>Mamonas Assassinas was a satirical Brazilian rock band. On March 2, 1996, the plane in which the band was traveling crashed into the Cantareira mountain range, near SÃ£o Paulo, causing the death of all five band members. The short lived band enjoyed a "meteoric" success, being celebrated for decades after its end and the members of the band are remembered and celebrated even today.</p>
